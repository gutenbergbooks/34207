<h2><i>Translator's Note</i></h2>


<p class="normal"><i>The translation of dramatic dialogue is attended with
special difficulties, and these are peculiarly marked in translating from German
into English. The German sentence carries more ballast than English readers are
accustomed to, and while in translating narrative one may, by means of
subordinate clauses, follow the conformation of the original, it is hard to do
so in rendering conversation, and virtually impossible when the conversation is
meant to be spoken on the stage. To English and American spectators the long
German speeches are a severe strain on the attention, and even in a translation
intended only for the &quot;closet&quot; a too faithful adherence to German construction
is not the best way of doing justice to the original.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>Herr Sudermann's dialogue is more concise than that of many
other German dramatists; yet in translation his sentences and speeches need to
be divided and recast: to preserve the spirit, the letter must be modified. This
is true not only of the construction of his dialogue but also of his forms of
expression. Wherever it has been possible, his analogies, his allusions, his
&quot;tours de phrase,&quot; have been scrupulously followed; but where they seemed to
obscure his meaning to English readers some adaptation has been necessary. Apart
from these trifling changes, the original has been closely followed; and such
modifications as have been made were suggested solely by the wish to reproduce
Herr Sudermann's meaning more closely than a literal translation would have
allowed.</i></p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="normal"><i>A drawing-room in the Empire style in </i><span class="sc2">
Count Kellinghausen's </span><i>house. In front, on the left, a fireplace; to
the left, in the background, a door to the inner apartments; to the right, back,
a door into the front passage; in the foreground, on the right, a window. In the
centre of back wall a wide opening between two columns, partly closed by an old
Gobelins tapestry. On the right a sofa, table and chairs. On the left, in front
of the fireplace, several low seats. Near the middle, placed diagonally, a
writing-table with shelves; beside the table two seats with low backs and a
comfortable arm-chair. Old portraits and coloured prints on the walls.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc2">Holtzmann </span><i>is seated at the back of
the room, a portfolio on his lap</i>. <span class="sc2">Conrad </span><i>ushers in </i><span class="sc2">
Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Conrad</span> (<i>in the doorway</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">If your Excellency will kindly come this
way--the doctor is with Madame von Kellinghausen.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah? In that case perhaps I had better----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Conrad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Madame von Kellinghausen will be here in a moment, your
Excellency. The other gentleman has already been announced. (<i>Indicating </i><span class="sc2">
Holtzmann</span>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well. (<span class="sc2">Conrad </span><i>goes out</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span> (<i>rises and makes a deep bow</i>).</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Bowing slightly in return wanders about the room and at
last pauses before </i><span class="sc2">Holtzmann</span>.) I beg your pardon
but--surely I know your face.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very likely, your Excellency. My name is Holtzmann, private
secretary to Baron Richard von Völkerlingk.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed? I am so seldom at my brother's. The fact is--er, well.
Yesterday was election-day at Lengenfeld, by the way. The papers were full of it
this morning. It seems to cause a good deal of surprise that Count Kellinghausen
should not only have withdrawn in favour of my brother, but should actually have
gone about canvassing for him. I daresay that's an exaggeration, though?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">On the contrary, your Excellency. The Count has been down in
the country electioneering for weeks.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really? And you were with him, I suppose?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span> (<i>with a dry smile</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Very much so, your Excellency. I should be
sorry to be answerable for all the nonsense I've had to talk and write!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--just so. Nonsense always wins. Who said that, by the way?
Julian the Apostate, wasn't it?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, your Excellency. Talbot.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Julian might have said it. The losing side always
philosophises.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hope we sha'n't be on the losing side.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm. What is your profession?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Theology, your Excellency.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And how long do you think it will be before it lands you in
socialism?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span> (<i>offended</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Excellency!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear sir, look at the examples! I remember a predecessor of
yours at my brother's--a theological student also, I believe. Well, he landed
with both feet in the middle of the Socialist camp.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I know, your Excellency. You mean Meixner.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That reminds me--I hear the fellow has actually been taking a
leading hand in the fight against my brother.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The report is true.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I hope you hit back hard.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That is what I was there for, your Excellency.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Beata </span><i>and </i><span class="sc">Dr.
Kahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hadn't dared to hope that your Excellency would answer my
summons so promptly.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span> (<i>kissing her hand</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">My dear Countess, your summons was a
command--and one I was only too happy to obey. (<span class="sc2">Beata </span><i>
turns to </i><span class="sc2">Holtzmann</span>.) Ah, good-morning, my dear
doctor.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good-morning, your Excellency. How is it you haven't been in
lately to let me look you over? A guilty conscience, eh?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Lack of time, doctor. Give me a day of twenty-five hours, and
I'll devote one of them to consulting my physician.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who will order you to rest during the other twenty-four.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We all get that order sooner or later, doctor--and from a
chief we have to obey. (<i>In a low voice</i>.) How is the Countess?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kahlenberg</span> (<i>same tone</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">No worse. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Beata</span>.)
And now, my dear lady, I must be off--but what's the matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>joyously excited, a paper in her hand</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Oh, nothing--nothing--nothing----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kahlenberg</span> (<i>in a tone of friendly reproach</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">You know I've warned you----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not to feel, not to think, not to laugh, not to cry--not to
live, in short, dear doctor!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kahlenberg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I don't object to the laughing.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's just as well you don't, for it's a habit you couldn't
break me of. There is so much to laugh at in this vale of tears! Well, good-bye,
doctor! (<span class="sc2">Kahlenberg </span><i>goes out</i>.) Beata (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Baron Ludwig</span>). This will
interest you too. Herr Holtzmann--you know Herr Holtzmann?--has just brought me
the returns from Lengenfeld. Only fancy, your brother has a majority of a
hundred and thirty-one! Think of that!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't let us be too sanguine.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Six districts are still to be heard from, Countess, and we
know that four of these belong to the Socialists. It is still doubtful if we can
gain a majority.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>concealing her disappointment</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">And when do you expect to hear the final
result?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At any moment now.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And when you <i>do</i> hear----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I will jump into a cab and bring you the news instantly.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you so 'much. (<i>Gives him her hand</i>.) Is Baron
Völkerlingk at home?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He went for a ride. I daresay I shall find him on my return.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Remember me to him, won't you? (<span class="sc2">Holtzmann </span><i>
takes leave with a bow</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you hear from Kellinghausen? He is still at
Lengenfeld, I hear.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have just had a letter. Now that the elections are over he
means to take a day's shooting, and then he is coming home--free from his
party-duties for the first time in years!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what does the Egeria of the party say to such a state of
things?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you mean <i>me</i>, your Excellency?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I mean the woman at whose delightful dinner-table the fate of
more than one important bill has been decided. Now that Kellinghausen has
retired into private life, do you mean to keep up the little political dinners
we've always been so much afraid of?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hope so, your Excellency. And if you care to beard the lion
in his den, I shall be charmed to send you an invitation. You haven't dined with
us in an age. I've always fancied that the estrangement between your brother and
yourself might be the cause of our seeing so little of you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess, those eyes of yours see through everything;
and I read in them all the answers I might make to that question. Ah,
well--Richard had the good luck, the unspeakable good luck, to win your
friendship, and under your influence, to develop into the man he is!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I know how to listen when clever men are talking. That is the
secret of what you call my influence.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You think so?--Well--there was Richard, dabbling in poetry and
politics, in archæology and explorations, like the typical noble amateur. He had
a fortune from his mother, while I was poor. But in one respect I was richer
than he; for he married a fool who dragged him down to the level of her own
silly snobbishness. But then you came--and lifted him up again. Then all his
dormant powers awoke--he discovered his gift as a speaker, he became the
mouthpiece of the party, he got into the Reichstag, and----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And dropped out again.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Exactly. And the estrangement between us dates from that time.
It was reported that government had left him in the lurch, and I was thought to
be more or less responsible.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At all events, his career was cut short. And he failed again
at the next election.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And now your friendship has helped him to success.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My husband's friendship, you mean.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In my loveless household I know too little of the power of
woman to pronounce definitely on that point.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You do well to suspend your judgment.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, now you are displeased with me. I am sorry. I might be of
use to you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you wish to be of use to me you can do so by becoming your
brother's friend. It was to ask you this that I sent for you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Countess, I wonder at your faith in human nature!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Human nature has never deceived me.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">One would adore you for saying that if one hadn't so many
other reasons for doing so!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Pretty speeches at our age?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You may talk of my age, but not of yours.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Look at the grey hair--here, on my temples; and my
medicine-bottles over there. I never stir without them now.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have been distressed to hear of your illness.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, my heart bothers me--an old story. My heart is tired--and
I--I'm not. And when I drive it too hard it grows a little restive now and then.
But it doesn't matter! (<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Ellen</span>.) Is that
you, Ellen? Come in, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span> (<i>in skating dress</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Mother, dear, I didn't know you had a
visitor. How do you do, your Excellency?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How do you do, young lady? Dear me dear me what have you been
growing into?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Into life, your Excellency!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha--very good--very neat. So many people just grow past it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And how was the skating, dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, heavenly. Norbert and I simply flew. Poor Miss
Mansborough--we left her miles behind!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, run away now. Take off your fur jacket--you're too warm.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good-bye, your Excellency.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Au revoir</i>, little Countess. (<span class="sc2">Ellen </span><i>

Usingen.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The pillars of the state! Brachtmann especially. This is
something for me to remember, Countess.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am so glad to see you. And you, Prince. Always faithful to
the cause?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Countess; as far as fidelity is consonant with perfect
inactivity. Glad to shake hands between two rounds, your Excellency.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Our encounters are not sanguinary, your Highness.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No although one adversary occasionally cuts another. (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We ventured to call, Countess, because we fancied that
Völkerlingk would keep you posted as to the news from Lengenfeld.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Baron Völkerlingk has done me no such honour. But--by the
merest accident--his secretary was here just now. Here are the latest returns. (<i>Hands
him the paper</i>.)</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span> (<i>bending over the paper</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">H'm, h'm----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me see.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, we'll hope for the best. Kellinghausen's personal
popularity has secured a conservative majority till now; but now that he has
withdrawn in favour of another man--even though that man is Völkerlingk--the
result is more than doubtful.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I confess, Countess, that even if Kellinghausen looked upon
his politics merely as a branch of sport, I don't quite understand his
sacrificing his career to my brother.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My husband is very easy-going. He has no ambition. They had
bothered him dreadfully at their committee-meetings about things he didn't
understand--at least he said he didn't. The truth is, it probably bored him.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But how about his fanatical devotion to the party? If we are
all monomaniacs on that subject, he is certainly the worst. He felt more keenly
than any of us what the party lost in losing your brother (<i>to </i>
<span class="sc2">Baron Ludwig</span>)--he realised our need of Völkerlingk's
efficiency and energy. He saw what a great power was lying idle. Doesn't that
explain his action?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I needn't tell you, Herr von Brachtmann, how pleasant it is to
hear my brother praised. I quite realise how much you need him at this
particular moment with the debate on the civil code pending, and the serious
questions likely to come up in connection with it. (<i>To </i>
<span class="sc2">Beata</span>.) But that Kellinghausen should have consented to
withdraw, even in such an emergency-- I have so often heard him say, Countess,
that it was the duty of a landed proprietor to represent the district in which
his property lay. He said it was the only justification of a representative
government.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you know you, all say that!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess, the revolutionary spirit has entered into
our traditions, and the modern idea of making a revolution is to gird at
existing institutions. Why deprive us of such an innocent amusement?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really, Prince--pardon me--but since, by birth and political
affiliations, you are a supporter of existing institutions, would it not be well
to speak of them less flippantly?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, my dear Baron?--Countess, shall I show you the attitude
of the modern state toward its citizens? Here we are: the state with its hand in
its pocket, the citizen with his fist clenched. And the only way to unclench the
citizen's fist is for the state to pull something out of its pocket. There's the
situation in a nutshell. It's a matter of taste whether one respects such an
institution or not.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You know. Baron, he is the spoiled child of the party.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Its prodigal son, you mean. I squandered all my original ideas
long ago, and am living on the husks of the feudal tradition. But we are boring
Madame von Kellinghausen. (<i>The three men rise</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good-bye, Prince--Herr von Brachtmann. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">
Baron Ludwig</span>.) Whenever your solitude weighs on you, come in and let me
give you a cup of tea.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are very good. But I am afraid it is too late to begin.</p>

<p class="normal">It is never too late to renew an old friendship.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--where?</p>
<br>

Richard is such a wonderful speaker? Norbert says he can do what he likes with
people.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Some people--but only those whose thoughts he can turn into
feelings, or whose feelings he can turn into thoughts. Do you understand?</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes! You mean, one can give only to those who have

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Presently, Norbert. Wait for me here.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't you want me, mother?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, dear. Stay with Norbert. I shall be back in a moment. (<i>She

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span> (<i>looking after her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Oh, Norbert!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is she really worse?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, she is just the same as usual. But at night--oh, Norbert,
she's never in bed. All night she wanders, wanders. When I hear her coming, I
lie quite still. If she knew I was awake she might not come any more. She never
touches me, but just bends over and strokes my pillow, oh, so softly! And she
breathes so hard, as if it hurt her--and then gradually she grows quiet again.
When you see her in the daytime, so gay and dear and busy, so full of other
people's pleasures, you'd never guess the misery she endures. Oh, Norbert, you <i>
do</i> love her, don't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I believe I love her better than my own mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no, Norbert, that's wicked. You mustn't say that.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps not, but I can't help feeling it. And why shouldn't I,
after all? When I was a boy my father was everything to me--after that he was
always travelling, and I was left to my own devices. There are so many things
that puzzle a chap when there's no one to talk them over with. It's different
with girls, I suppose. At first I used to go to my mother: <i>she's</i> always
found life simple enough. Visits, and parties, and church--she looks upon
church-going as another kind of visiting--well, do you know what <i>she</i> said
to me? &quot;In the first place, my dear boy, your trousers are shocking. What you
need is a good tailor. Then you ought to take up lawn tennis--and after that,
we'll see.&quot; Well, that didn't help me much. And then your mother took pity on
me. Again and again she's let me sit up half the night, talking things over with
her.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And now you and she have got something to say to each other
again. What is it, Norbert? Do tell me! Why can't <i>I</i> help you as well as
mother?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps you'd like to do my examination papers for me?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nonsense; it's not that.--But you don't care for me any more.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You silly child!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You told me you did once--long ago--but since then--you've
never once----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Listen, dear. I made an awful ass of myself that day. Do you
know what I did? I called on your father to ask his permission to marry you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And you never told me?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Luckily your father was out--and as for your mother--well, she
simply laughed at me!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Ellen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, you know how your mother laughs at one. It doesn't hurt.
&quot;Dear boy,&quot; she said, in the kindest way, &quot;it's too soon to talk of such things
to Ellen. You must give her time to grow up.&quot; And I gave her my word I would;
and you see I've kept it.</p>

<p class="normal">Ellen, dear, go to Miss Mansborough. It's time for your

<p class="normal">Yes, mother. (<i>Goes out</i>.)</p>

<p class="normal">I've kept it, Aunt Beata.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then you want to talk to me about something else?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. The storm-signals are up. My college club has turned on
me: one, two, three, and out you go!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not in disgrace?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm not so sure. I got an official letter yesterday from the
committee, asking me if I was the author of a pamphlet called &quot;The Ordeal.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why did you write it under an assumed name?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Only on my father's account.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you disguised yourself at all, you ought to have done so
more thoroughly.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Aunt Beata! Haven't you often told me that every reformer
must have the courage of his convictions?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes; but I've no sympathy with unnecessary martyrdom. Keep a
cool head, dear boy, and don't be drawn into controversy just yet. Haven't I
often told you that this college duelling you rail against is only a preparation
for the real battle of life--the battle of ideas and beliefs? You'll come to
that later--ask your father how it is!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, father--of course he's only interested in big things.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What does he say to your article?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Immature.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Was he vexed?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When I asked him if it annoyed him, he laughed and said:--&quot;I
know the world too well to agree with you. But you must work out the problem for
yourself. I sha'n't interfere.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what more do you want? Did you expect him to go into
raptures?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wait and see, Aunt Beata! I mean to suffer for my convictions.
I mean to brave persecution. Is that a laughing matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Come! Come! No bragging--not even about persecution. It's
intoxicating at first, but the after-taste is bitter.</p>

<p class="normal">Did Holtzmann do as well as you expected?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Admirably. But he's been going about with such a long face
lately that he's rather got on my nerves.--I heard you had told him to come back
when the returns are in--may I wait for him here?--When one thinks that
something will come in at that door presently--something dressed like Holtzmann,
looking like Holtzmann--and that that something will be Fate--nothing more or
less than Fate!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And if he comes in and says--or rather, if he doesn't say
anything? Remember, Richard, even if <i>that</i> happens, you've got to go on
living!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course. Why not? It's all in the day's work. An Indian
penitent was once asked: &quot;Why do you go on living?&quot; And his answer was: &quot;Because
I am dead.&quot;--Oh, I don't mean to be ungrateful. As long as I have you, dear--as
long as you are here to live my life with me, to give it colour and meaning and
purpose--let come what may, nothing else matters.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't say that--don't----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Am I exaggerating? Why, ever since we-- How long ago is it
that we met for the first time, in the wood at Tarasp? Fifteen years?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems like yesterday.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You passed between the dark pine-trunks like an apparition.
You wore a pink dress and had Ellen by the hand.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She was tired and had begun to cry.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I saw that she wanted to be carried.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And I was just recovering from an illness, and was too weak to
lift her. You raised your hat--no, it was the white cap you wore----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you remember that?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good heavens, what was I then, and what have you made of me?
My own--let me call you that just once, Richard, as I used to do--just once, on
this great day--my own! (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>looks nervously
toward the door</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is no one coming.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Let</i> you!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What a quiet happy little woman I was! That &quot;happy&quot; is not
meant as a reproach, dearest! I have a boundless capacity for happiness, and it
kept me company even in the loneliness of my early married life--for in those
days Michael didn't take much notice of me. It was you who showed him that I was
worth noticing. And so you built up my new life--a hard life to carry, at times,
a life bowed under its own wealth as the vine is bowed under its fruit--but how
it has grown under your hand, dearest, how it has spread and strengthened!--Now
you're laughing at me, Richard.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata--no one knows as you do how I have blundered and
struggled. What are you trying to do? Do you want to give me more faith in
myself, or do you really think I've done all that for you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I know every line in your forehead, I watch every look in your
eye, I read every thought in your soul--there are some I could wish away, for
they only make you miserable--but no one knows as I do what you are, and what
you have been to me!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When will Michael be here?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How suddenly you ask that! You are tormenting yourself again.
Dear--dearest--don't look like that! Why, it never really happened--it's been
dead and buried for years--dead and buried, every trace of it. No one knows what
we were to each other, no one even dreams it. And we're old people now--you and
I. Only think, I shall soon be forty! Who is going to ask two old mummies what
follies they committed in the year one?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are pretending not to care, Beata. Don't do that!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't weigh every word I say--just look into my wicked heart.
Your conscience has nothing to do with that! And if you're fond of Michael--if
we're both fond of him--and why shouldn't we both be fond of him--that dear,
good, cheery Michael of ours?--why, that needn't make you probe the depths of
your soul for fresh wickedness. I tell you we've paid for everything, even to
the uttermost farthing!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you think so? It seems to me that when a man and a woman
have found everything in each other, as we have, when they have been to each
other the strength and the meaning and the object of life--when they've resolved
to die fighting back to back, together to the last, as you used to say it seems
to me that in such a case there isn't much room for expiation. If Purgatory is
like that it must be fairly habitable. (<span class="sc2">Beata </span><i>laughs</i>.)
Ah, now you are flippant.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Be thankful that one of us is, dear!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I remember when I lost my seat, six years ago--it was a hard
knock, I can tell you--everything went under at once--well, I said to myself:
This is my punishment. And the idea never left me. While I was wandering about
the world, or vegetating down in the country, I actually used to get a kind of
comfort out of it. And now? Do you know, I sometimes fancy you wouldn't be
altogether sorry if I lost my election again.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>laughingly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Really? Do you think that?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In fact I'm not at all sure you hold with the party any
longer.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What--I, its Egeria? An elderly party-nymph gone wrong? What a
shocking idea!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm sure of one thing you enjoy looking over our heads.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't say <i>our</i> heads--don't include yourself with the
rest. You think of your duty; they think of their rights. You use the masses in
order to serve them. The others think only of power.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, as to that--we all want power.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes: the question is, for whose benefit?--Ah, well, I see I
shall have to tell you--you ought to know--the sooner the better, I suppose!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me what?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear--did you really think it was Michael's fondest wish to
resign his seat in Parliament, and live only for his horses?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I've heard him say so often enough.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so you leaped into the breach--in the interests of the
party?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>hesitating</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">And because--(<i>suddenly</i>)
Beata--there's been some deception? (<span class="sc2">Beata </span>
<i>nods</i>.) Some one has been working against me----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Or for you--as you please.--Sit down beside me, dear; give me
both your hands--so! And now listen. I couldn't bear to see your
disappointment--your suffering--I suffered with you too intensely! And so--don't
look so startled, or I shall lose heart and be afraid to go on.--How shall I
tell you?--It's taken me a year a whole year's work. By degrees I persuaded him
that he was unsuited to Parliamentary life--gradually I turned him against the
pottering routine-work which is the only thing he can do--little by little I
made him see what a boon it would be for the country and the party if he would
only let you take his place. Till at last he did----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>rising</i>).</p>

<p class="normal"><p class="normal">Ah----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Can you say <i>now</i> that I didn't want you elected? (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>
is silent</i>.) I should never have told you this if I hadn't known that his
pride in his heroic feat would make him betray himself sooner or later. (<i>A
pause</i>.) After all, think how little he's given up! To him it was only
a--pastime--to you it is life. I had no choice, had I? You do see that, don't
you? (<i>A pause</i>.) Richard, I may be a very wicked woman, but at least I
deserve one look from you!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata! Beata! What can I say? What can I say? You know how
I've always tried to keep our feeling for each other within the bounds--the
bounds of-- You know how it was twelve years ago--when I found myself gradually
slipping into intimacy with him, I came to you and said: &quot;Either this thing ends
here, or I tell him everything. I won't take his hand and play the sneak. If I
do, we shall lose our respect for each other as well as our self-respect.&quot; And
then we hit on this friendship as a way out of it--a way of not losing each
other altogether. It wasn't a very honourable solution--but this--this new
sacrifice--if I accept this--God! If Holtzmann were to come in now and tell me
the other man has won, what a load he would take off my mind!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Richard--how can you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Think of it: To-morrow I shall have to make that speech. My
position, my convictions, compel me to appear as the spokesman of the highest
ideals--and all the while I shall owe my seat to the friend whose holiest ties I
have trampled on----</p>

was I going to say? Oh, yes: well, you see, I've got four boys growing up; one
is in the Rathenow Hussars--crack regiment, you know--I always look out for that
sort of thing--but costs like the devil! The second is with the Pacific squadron
on board the Princess William. <i>He</i>
doesn't cost as much except when he's ashore. The third is to study forestry,
and just now he's with his rifle-corps. The fourth is at college--Bonn--belongs
to all the most expensive clubs--but smart, deuced smart! That's the chief
thing. I expect all four to make their living out of the state, but meanwhile

<p class="normal">&quot;But now and then a happy accident yields us an edifying
glimpse of their private histories. And, if I might venture to speak openly, I
could give you such a glimpse into the private life of the honourable member
from Lengenfeld, and into his relations with the friend whose seat in the
Reichstag he has taken--the confiding friend who, instead of keeping watch in
his own house, has been travelling from place to place, canvassing for the
honourable member. (Laughter. Prolonged cheering.)&quot; Lengenfeld? Lengen--why,
that is Völkerlingk's district. (<span class="sc2">Brachtmann </span><i>nods
affirmatively</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">von Berkelwitz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And the friend--the friend who----? (<i>He breaks off, and

The deuce!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">On account of the party I suppose we shall have to take some
notice of this.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Kellinghausen evidently doesn't know of it yet. But
Völkerlingk does. I watched him.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The Countess is not well. Who is the proper person to take
that paper away before she sees it?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, frankly, I should say Völkerlingk----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You don't mean----</p>

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">von Berkelwitz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Gentlemen, I'm only a plain country squire, but I should like
to suggest that the morals of our hostess are hardly a subject for discussion.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Morals? Morals? What do morals signify? They were only
invented for the preservation of the race.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">von Berkelwitz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's over my head, your Highness.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's simple enough. Mankind is bound to go on reproducing
itself--that's its fundamental instinct. Morality was invented to keep the
strain pure. If it ceases to accomplish that purpose, it had better abdicate in
favour of immorality. That's all.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">von Berkelwitz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll be hanged if I understand a single word.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We all know the old families wouldn't have survived till now

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really, Prince--really----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Brachtmann, it's all very well for you to look
shocked. Your family hasn't had to resort to such expedients: your patent of
nobility isn't more than two hundred years old. But my people have been
misbehaving since the time of Lewis the Pious. Look at the result--look at <i>me</i>.
Jaw prognathous--frontal bone asymmetrical--ears abnormal--all the symptoms of a
decaying race. Thanks to several centuries of inbreeding, I must go through life
a degenerate, and I assure you I haven't any talent for it. If only I could
marry a healthy dairy-maid! Under such circumstances, do you wonder one loses
one's respect for morality? What if two people in this house have followed the
dictates of their temperament?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Prince, von Berkelwitz is right. As long as we're in the house
ourselves, we'll postpone any discussion of its inmates.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">As you please. (<span class="sc2">Richard Völkerlingk </span><i>
is seen approaching. The </i><span class="sc2">Prince </span>
<i>glances toward him</i>.) Which won't prevent my feeling the sincerest
sympathy for our friend there. His phenomenal self-possession is enough to
confirm my suspicions.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I've been looking for you every where, Brachtmann. I want to
shake hands and tell you how glad I am to be under your orders again.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We won't talk of being under my orders, my dear Völkerlingk.
You know how badly we need you, and how anxious we are to have you take the lead
in the coming debate. (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>bows</i>.) I suppose
we may count on your speaking on the Divorce Bill next Friday?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>hesitating</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Why--I had hardly expected----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's the very thing we want of you. According to the
Socialists, a man and his wife are no more bound to each other than a pair of
cuckoos. We need a speaker of your eloquence and your convictions to proclaim
the sanctity of the marriage-bond.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I hardly know if I should have time to get my facts
together. And besides-- (<i>He draws </i><span class="sc2">Brachtmann </span><i>
aside and continues in a low tone</i>.) An hour or two ago I received a copy of
a speech that a fellow called Meixner has been making against me. The man is a
former secretary of mine, turned Socialist----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--Meixner was your secretary?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You knew of this?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Völkerlingk, don't you see that after such an attack
it's doubly important that you should speak on this very question? As for the
party, I think I may say in its name that our asking you to do so is equivalent
to a vote of confidence.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks, Brachtmann. I believe you're right. My refusal might
be misinterpreted.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span> (<i>turning toward the others</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">We were speaking of this when you joined us. We have all
received copies of the paper.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>to the group</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Then I must apologise for not having mentioned the matter; but
I was waiting to bring it before you in committee. It seems to be a question of
personal spite, for my son has received the paper too.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And Madame von Völkerlingk?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My wife? Why do you ask?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Look at this. (<i>Leads </i><span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>

starts, but controls himself instantly</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We were just wondering how we could get rid of the thing
before it is discovered, and we had reluctantly decided that none of us is
sufficiently intimate here to tamper with the Countess's papers. Now, if <i>you</i>,
my dear Baron--as an old friend of the family--knowing how important it is to
spare her any excitement----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>looking at him sharply</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">There is only one person entitled to remove that paper, and
that is Count Kellinghausen. I will speak to him at once.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Irreproachable!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Völkerlingk, for heaven's sake leave Kellinghausen out
of the question!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How can I?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have been in politics long enough to take such incidents
philosophically. But Kellinghausen, easy-going as he is, strikes me as the kind
of man who might make an ass of himself in such an emergency. If he loses his
head he may do the party an incalculable amount of harm; whereas, if we can keep
this thing from him, it will blow over in a week, and nobody be any the worse
for it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you forget that I am as much involved in this as
Kellinghausen. It is impossible that I should stand aside and allow any
reflection to be cast on--er----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are quite right. But wait a moment. You said you meant to
bring the matter up in committee, which is undoubtedly the proper way of dealing
with it. The committee meets the day after to-morrow; and all I ask is that you
should say nothing till then.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And suppose I agree to that what becomes of this paper? (<i>Pointing
to the writing-table</i>.) What if the Countess finds it?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">von Berkelwitz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Gentlemen, I'm only a plain country squire, and I haven't your
refinements of conscience. (<i>He takes the paper, tears it up and throws it
into the wastepaper basket</i>. <span class="sc2">Brachtmann </span><i>and the </i><span class="sc2">Prince </span><i>laugh</i>.)</p>

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, there you are, Richard! My dear fellow, I've been hunting
for you high and low. I was actually reduced to asking Madame von Völkerlingk
where you were. &quot;My dear Count,&quot; she said, &quot;it's fifteen years since I've known
where my husband was.&quot; Nice reputation you've got! Well, now I've run you to
earth, sit down and let's have a talk. (<i>To the others</i>.) I haven't had a
chance to say two words to him yet.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Brachtmann, shall we----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no; don't run off. Richard and I have no secrets. Let us
take possession of this quiet corner. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Conrad</span>, <i>

there? Lion brew from the wood, eh?</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, your Excellency.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's what we always had at Bismarck's. H'm--in those days
there was a power in the land. It weighed on us rather heavily at times, but we
were none the worse for it. Your health, Richard, my dear fellow! Gentlemen,
your healths! How deuced quiet you all are! You look as if I'd invited you to my
own funeral. Good Lord, if you knew how glad I am to have got the Reichstag off
my shoulders!--The other day, down at the polls, I said to one of our Lengenfeld
peasants: &quot;My dear friend--&quot; (they're all our dear friends at election-time; we
even have to put up with being <i>their</i> dear friends). &quot;My dear friend,&quot;
said I, &quot;I hope you're going to vote for my successor?&quot;--&quot;What will he give me
for it?&quot; says he. &quot;What will the Socialist give you?&quot; said I. &quot;The Socialist
will call you all names, and I like to hear you called names. It makes me
laugh,&quot; the fellow answered. And he was right. We must amuse the masses and
they'll love us. Circus-riding, my dear friends that's all the nobility are good
for!</p>

<p class="normal">We shall miss your cheerful view of life, my dear

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--that's about the only epitaph I can hope for. Ha!
ha!--Well--I say, Richard, what sort of a fellow is that Meixner? (<i>The others

<p class="normal">Yes; Holtzmann told me about him. And I've had a lot of his

<p class="normal">My dear Leonie, remember that you are in my house.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Leonie</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Beata, we are always in each other's houses; we can't
meet at the street corners, like servants.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are right. Say what you were going to say.</p>

<p class="normal">Why have you, if you had anything to say?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Leonie</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Listen, Beata. I am not going to discuss the relations between
my husband and yourself. It's a subject that no longer interests me. But it was
you who took him away from me, and when I found you had taken him, I turned to
my boy instead. Then you took him too. Now I have nothing left--nothing but my
position in society, which I have built up slowly, year by year, by my own
efforts, as you know. I am in the Princess Agnes's most intimate set, I am
patroness of--but all this doesn't interest you. But how have I accomplished it?
Simply by keeping my eyes shut and appearing to sanction your friendship with
Richard.--And now, if you persist in dragging your husband in, there will be a
scandal, and I shall have to sue for a divorce; and that will be excessively
unpleasant for us all. Don't you agree with me?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I might say so many things in reply.--In the first place,
whatever I have taken was never really yours.--But no matter. I will only ask
you one thing: have you thought of Ellen and Norbert?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Leonie</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, Ellen and Norbert! I've no objection to the match, none
whatever--but it's <i>your</i> scheme, not mine, and you can't expect me to be
particularly enthusiastic about it. But I should think it would be one more
reason for <i>you</i> to keep quiet.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then--if you don't mean to do anything--why did you bring me
this?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Leonie</span> (<i>with irrepressible triumph</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Why did I bring it? Because I--(<i>relapses into her usual

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Brachtmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--but that's the point.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg your pardon, Herr von Brachtmann, I thought truth was
truth, no matter who uttered it.</p>

<p class="normal">What is truth? said Pilate.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And washed his hands. We also wash our hands of many things,
your Highness. I have even heard it said that the use of soap and water is the
only thing that distinguishes us from the masses. But no matter how much washing
we do, we can't wash off the blood we have shed in the abuse of our
class-privileges.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Prince</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Richard</span>).
Very neatly parried. He has a good wrist.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Norbert, will you give your venerable parent a
hearing? We have left far behind us many of what you call our
&quot;class-privileges&quot;; but their traditional spirit still survives. And that
spirit, whether the modern world condemns it, or the middle-classes make it
ridiculous by aping it--that spirit is the safeguard of our order. Believe me,
Norbert, we must stand or fall by it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then we must fall, father.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Possibly--even probably. But meanwhile the one distinction we
have left is the right to dispose of our lives. When a nobleman of the Italian
Renaissance, or a young blade of the court of Louis XIII., crossed the threshold
of his house, he was never sure of re-entering it alive. That was what gave him
his audacity, his splendid indifference to danger. Today we no longer stake our
lives so lightly; but the fact that they are ours to stake still gives its
keenest edge to living.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">The Others</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hear! Hear!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear father, you have given us an admirable explanation of
the personal view of death. But life is not a personal matter at all. You have
said so often enough. Our lives belong to the ideals for which we fight, they
belong to the state or to the race----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And how about our personal sense of honour? What of that,
Norbert? Are we to be forbidden to defend with our lives the few things we hold
sacred on earth? May we no longer fall upon the scoundrel who assails them? You
will hardly convince us of that, Norbert.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then again, Norbert, there may be cases--you are too young to
have foreseen them, but they exist--where an honourable man may have done
irreparable injury to another's honour. If he admits his guilt, and satisfaction
is demanded of him, what is he to do? Is he to run away, or to shelter himself
behind the law? The law, which was made to protect the honour of serfs! Should
you expect that of him, Norbert?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If your man of honour admits his guilt, and is ready to pay
the penalty, let him be his own judge.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I beg your pardon, father; that is hardly the point. It
was all very well for the aristocracy to make its own laws when it had the power
to enforce them; but what is to become of its precious &quot;class-privileges&quot; when
the modern world laughs at them and the mob refuses to recognise them? When that
day comes, I don't see what we can do but take shelter behind the law.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't understand you, Norbert. Give us an instance.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing easier, Uncle Michael. What do you propose to do with
the scoundrel who has been insulting you in his electioneering speeches? (<i>There
is a startled movement among his listeners</i>.) You don't mean to challenge <i>
him</i>, I suppose?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Unless you treat the whole matter with silent contempt and I
fancy you'll hardly do that it seems to me that a libel suit is the only
alternative.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Norbert--are you dreaming--or----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Why--Uncle Michael--didn't you know?</p>

always answered: &quot;The only way is to avoid excitement.&quot; Well--I've borne that in
mind--I've schooled myself to look at life through a tombstone, as it were--my
own tombstone, doctor! I've done that. But now--now there are storms ahead,
perhaps disasters. If they come, my judgment and energy are equal to them--but
my valves are not. I found that out last night--it was only those drops of yours
that saved me. But I can't live on those drops--you've warned me not to take
them too often. And I don't want to die of this. Doctor, you must help me!</p>

Strophanthus and digitalis are not meant for human nature's daily food. Besides,

<p class="normal">You call it conscience, Beata; I call it consistency. How dare
I speak on this bill, how dare I take such a stand before God and man, when my
whole life gives me the lie?--Good God!--To stand up and talk about the sanctity
of marriage--about the family life as the main support of society--to parade
such an argument before the cynics of the Opposition, when with my own hands I
have helped to tear down that very support--no, no, I can't justify myself
without adopting their own cynical and materialistic creed. And not even then;
for what I call God they call social expediency; and this new idol of theirs is
more exacting than the Jehovah of the old dispensation. As to acknowledging that
words are one thing and actions another--that the man in me is not accountable
to the statesman--well, I haven't sunk as low as that--what I give I must give
without an afterthought.--And so all my ideas crumble into dust, all my
reasoning ends in contradiction--and I find myself powerless to plead the very
cause I have at heart!</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me. I am so tired; my mind is a blank. First that
dreadful scene last night, when a moment's hesitation would have ruined us both.
Then my long night at my desk--the superhuman effort of collecting my thoughts
after all I'd been through. But as I worked, my subject took such hold of me
that I've only just waked up to the question--how on earth is it all to end? (<span class="sc2">Beata </span><i>

self! To have the right to stand up openly for one's convictions! I would give

death would be--but don't be frightened; I shall do nothing foolish. There are
two of us, and we must hold together. I am so used to sharing every thought with

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is that your answer? You, who tell me you have wrestled with
yourself all night because--Richard, I don't believe you!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Believe me or not, but be sure that, whatever happens, no
suspicion shall fall on you--on either of us. And now I beg of you--let me see
Michael alone.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Alone?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>still smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Hush! Do you hear his latch-key?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata, I implore you. You are not fit to bear what is coming!
If you value your life, go----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I value yours, and therefore I shall stay.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span> (<i>very gravely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Good-afternoon, Richard. (<i>Shakes hands with him</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good-afternoon, Michael.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Beata</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Has any one been here?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Norbert--and Dr. Kahlenberg. No one else.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Kahlenberg? At this hour? Is any one ill?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No. He merely came to see me. Shall I give you some tea?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks, no. Richard, you don't want any either? Then, if
you'll come into my study----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">With pleasure.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael, I don't understand you. You have never shut me out
from your counsels. Hitherto, if I have taken part in your discussions, it was
because you wished me to; to-day I have a right to be here.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear child, don't you always have your way? If Richard
doesn't object----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Whatever you wish----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But first I want to give you a piece of good news. Norbert and
Ellen are engaged.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span> (<i>his face lighting up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ha? What? Those two children? I saw it coming, bless their
hearts!--but I'd no notion--where are they, Beata? (<i>Goes to door, left</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>in a low tone, to </i><span class="sc2">
Beata</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">He knows nothing.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>with an effort</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Michael--never mind--don't speak to them now! To-morrow
Norbert will---- (<i>She breathes painfully</i>. <span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>makes a startled
movement</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is it? Are you ill?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No--no, it's nothing. But happiness reverberates so! Norbert
is coming back to-morrow. He wishes to tell his mother first.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, that's thoughtful of him. I had forgotten about his
mother. Well, shake hands, old man. Confound it--I'm ashamed to look you in the
face with this cursed thing hanging over us. And to think how happy we three
might be--oh, that hound, that vile infamous hound!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me what happened, Michael.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There isn't much to tell. My lawyer had a talk with him. He
says his only object is to bring out the facts.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well--let him bring them out.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let him? You should have heard Brachtmann. The man was beside
himself. He began with the old story of the Frenchman who said that if he were
accused of stealing the towers of Notre Dame he would take the first train for
the frontier. &quot;No matter how blameless you all are, the lie will stick to you,&quot;
he said. &quot;It will stick to you and to your children and to your party.&quot; I had to
give him my word of honour that, whatever happens, I will do nothing to bring
scandal on the party.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you haven't stuck to your resolve?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How could I? We can't wring the scoundrel's neck without
landing ourselves in prison. Norbert was right yesterday. In such cases we have
no refuge left but the courts. There is more in that boy's ideas than I was
willing to admit at the time. Well--meanwhile I've agreed to think the matter
over for twenty-four hours. A mere formality, of course--and yet not quite,
after all. The fact is, I wanted to talk it out with you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata--Richard--I don't need to be told that there's nothing
wrong in this house--nothing wrong between you two, to put it plainly. I can see
that for myself. But in such a dirty business the most harmless fact may be used
against you; and you won't misunderstand me if I ask you--both-- You see, you
two have always been in such close sympathy--I don't say that to reproach
you--God forbid! It was natural enough--you're both so much cleverer than I
am--but I ask you, for all our sakes, to look back and try to remember if you've
ever written each other any letters that might--might seem--to an outsider--a
little too friendly? Good heavens! <i>I</i> should understand it if you had!
Or--or--have you ever written anything about <i>me</i>? Anything that might--?
There are plenty of things to criticise about me. But I must know the truth.
There must not be the least pretext for this attack. I ask you to stop and
consider.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is nothing to consider, my dear Michael.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not so fast, my dear fellow! Take time. Think the matter over.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is nothing to think over.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My answer is the same as Richard's, of course.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Richard, our fate is in your hands. Do you advise me to bring
suit?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh--if you ask my advice----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't ask your advice but your assurance. I have pledged
myself not to endanger the party. Give me your word of honour that I can bring
suit without doing so.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>straightening himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I give you my word of honour that--you---- (<span class="sc2">Beata </span><i>
gives a suppressed cry</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is the matter? What ails you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>looking at </i><span class="sc2">Richard</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">He will give you his word of honour, and then he will go home
and blow his brains out. Don't you see it in his face?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Kellinghausen, ask your wife to leave the room, and I will----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Richard, for fifteen years we have shared all our joys and
sorrows. We must share this too.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Half strangled, tearing his collar open, and then throwing
himself on </i><span class="sc2">Richard</span>.) You--you--you!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>seizing both his hands</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Michael, take care! This must be between ourselves. Remember
that.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--yes--yes; I pledged my word--I remember--I--oh,
you--you---- (<i>He sinks down in a chair near the table, and hides his face
with tearless sobs</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>approaching him after a pause</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Dear Michael, Richard and I conquered our feelings long ago.
That is why we are so calm now. What happened between us happened years ago, and
we are ready to pay the cost, whatever it is.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, as far as he's concerned, it's simple enough. He and I can
soon settle our account.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you--you--how can you justify yourself? How have you
reconciled it to your conscience to live beside me half a lifetime with this
thing between us? Why didn't you come and ask me to set you free?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--that was what <i>he</i> wanted--he has such a sense of
honour! And to this day he has never understood why I wouldn't. I loved him too
well to ruin his life--that's all. Even if he could have got a divorce and
married me, such a marriage would have been his ruin. I should simply have
finished the work that Leonie had begun. But what I wanted was to save him. And
so all these years I have lied for him----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what have you done for <i>me</i>? Or didn't I enter into
your calculations?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Michael, you must see that we can't discuss that now. It would
be laughable if I were to try to explain to you----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha! Ha! Lies and deception! Wife--friend--everything!
Everything! (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Richard</span>.) Why do you stand there as if you were struck
dumb? Why don't
<i>you</i> try and whitewash yourself too?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You said just now that our account was easy to settle.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He sees things differently. I speak for myself. He looks at
things as you do.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And yet----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wait, please! I have one word more to say, I have staked
everything and lost--it's all over for us, all three of us. If I had spoken
years ago, the same thing would have happened. You told me just now that I had
made you happy. Well, that is what my lie has done. It has made you happy for
fifteen years. Blame me for it--but don't forget it----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And God--and retribution? Do you never think of such things?
No repentance--no remorse? Nothing? Nothing?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Spare her, Michael. Let me answer for her. (<span class="sc2">Kellinghausen </span><i>
advances toward him with clenched fist</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You have questioned <i>me</i>, Michael; let me question you.
Must every natural instinct end in remorse and repentance? Sin? I am not
conscious of sinning. I did the best that it was in me to do. I simply refused
to be crushed by your social laws. I asserted my right to live; my right to
self-preservation. Perhaps it was another way of suicide--that's no matter. You
know what my life has been--how I've had to buy it, hour by hour and drop by
drop, at the nearest chemist's--well, wretched as it is, I've loved it too
dearly to disown it now! Yes, I've loved it--I've loved everything--everything
around me--you too, Michael--ah, don't laugh--yes, you too--even if I've--ah-- (<i>Her
breath comes in long gasps and she reels and clutches a chair, closing her eyes
as she leans against it. Then she opens them again</i>.) Which one of you
will--help me to the door? (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>makes a movement,
and then draws back</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata, from now on there will be no one to help you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you. (<i>With an intense effort, she walks out of the
room</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Richard</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">And now----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do what you like. Say what you like. Curse me--shoot me. I
sha'n't defend myself.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You admit that one of us must die?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No; I don't admit it; but I am at your orders.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A duel between us is impossible----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Impossible----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't mean on account of the children. <i>That's</i> all at
an end.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why must it be at an end if one of us dies? But I am at your
orders.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have pledged my word not to bring any scandal on the party.
You are under the same obligation.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So that the only thing left----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Before you go any further, let me tell you that I decline to
go through the farce of an American duel.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You decline--? Perhaps you want to sneak out of the whole
business?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You don't believe that!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well--what other way is there?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I know a way--but---- (<span class="sc2">Norbert's </span><i>

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>With sudden decision, opening the door</i>.) Norbert!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>following him</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">For God's sake, Michael--do you want to disgrace my whole
house?</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span> (<i>opening the door</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">You shall see.--Norbert! Come in, my boy--come!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert </span><i>enters</i>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Uncle Michael, what is the matter with Aunt Beata? The doctor
is with her, and Ellen has been called----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing serious. Don't be alarmed. (<i>Takes his hand</i>.)
Norbert, your father and I were just talking of last evening. You remember that
stupid business interrupted our talk, and we never heard the end of your
argument. Let us have it now. Sit down--sit down, Richard. (<i>They all seat
themselves</i>.) There was one phrase of yours that struck me. You said--you
said--that if----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You said that if a man of honour has injured another and is
called on to atone for it, he is the best judge of his own punishment.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Did I? Very likely--but my head is so full of other things
just now that I couldn't swear to it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That was not quite what I meant; but no matter. Suppose we
take such a case. If the injured person says: &quot;One of us two must die&quot;--what
ought the other to answer?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Uncle Michael, I should say that depended on the nature
of the injury--doesn't it?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the wrong is the
gravest that one man can do another; let us say he has seduced his friend's
wife. Has the husband a right to the other man's life?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, father--there can be but one answer to that. And if the
other man is a man of honour--though I don't see how he could be, do you?--he
would be more eager to give his life than the husband could possibly be to take
it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm. Perhaps you're right. Thank you, my boy.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Uncle Michael, at what time to-morrow may I see you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll send you word, Norbert.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks. Don't make it too late, will you? Don't keep me
waiting too long. Good-bye. Good-bye, father. (<i>Goes out</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well--are you satisfied?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Kellinghausen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You put the question in a way that suggests suicide. That was
not----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is your own choice. All I ask is two days' respite. You

<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<br>
<p class="normal"><i>A study in the house of </i><span class="sc2">Richard Völkerlingk</span>. <i>Doors
on the right and left, at the back. A fireplace in the middle background, the
rest of the wall hidden by book-cases, which frame the fireplace and doors. In
the foreground, to the left, a window. To the right of it, a writing-table. In
the centre a table covered with periodicals and books. On the right a leather
sofa and arm-chairs. Behind these a door. Rich and sombre decorations, old
pictures, armour, etc. A hanging-lamp with a green shade, another lamp on a

<br>
<p class="stage"><i>Enter </i><span class="sc">George</span>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">George.</span></p>
<br>
<p class="normal">Herr Holtzmann, some one is asking for the Baron.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, you know the Baron is at the Reichstag.
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">George.</span></p>
<br>
<p class="normal">He says it's important that the Baron should see him. He wants
to know when he can call again.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know who it is?
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">George.</span></p>
<br>
<p class="normal">Well--not exactly a gentleman. What shall I tell him?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The Baron speaks this afternoon. He will not leave till the
House rises. Tell the man to come back in an hour. (<span class="sc2">George </span><i>goes
out</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert </span><i>enters</i>.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span> (<i>greatly excited</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Herr Holtzmann--haven't you been at the Reichstag? (<span class="sc2">Holtzmann </span><i>
shakes his head without speaking</i>.) Then you haven't heard? My father has had
the most wonderful triumph--they say there has never been anything like it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I wish I could give you an idea of it! Look at me--I'm shaking
all over! If you could have heard the way the words rushed out, the way the
thoughts trod on each other's heels! He began by sketching the psychology of the
modern man, and from that he developed a theory of marriage, with its outward
obligations and inner ideals--the marriage of to-day in its highest, noblest
sense--but you'll read what he said; you'll see if I'm exaggerating. Then he
went on to the practical application of his theory. In this unsettled age, when
parents are losing their control over their children, and the state its hold
over the citizen, when even God and His priests see the soul of man slipping
away from them--at such a time we must do all we can to strengthen the only tie
that holds humanity together--the only tie that gives youth the shelter of the
family life till habit becomes duty, and duty the law of being, and through
obedience to that law a strong and enduring national soul is created. Isn't that
beautiful, Herr Holtzmann? Isn't that a glorious idea?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very fine, very fine. But doesn't such an argument lead back
to the standpoint of the Church, which----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When marriage is a mockery, he said, the state may intervene
and dissolve it. That was all. Never in my life have I heard such a scathing
denunciation of infidelity!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Holtzmann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah? Indeed?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">I have heard nothing. But, Norbert, listen. Whatever comes to
you in after days, I want you to remember one thing: it doesn't matter whether
we succeed or not. What we need is the guiding note of a voice that seems the
echo of our best hopes. It doesn't matter whether we are mistaken in the voice
or not--the great thing is to hear it. And the worst thing is not to feel the
need of it.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Norbert</span>.</p>

him alone for a day or two--even if you have the chance of speaking. And let me

<p class="normal">Leonie is out.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">So much the better. But first let me tell you with what
admiration I listened to you just now--what breathless admiration! (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>
makes a gesture of thanks</i>.) Still, I confess that your having to speak on
such a subject just at present made me--er--a little nervous----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why so?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I was almost afraid--but we'll go into that presently.--Well,
at all events, if nothing goes wrong, you may look upon this as the
starting-point of a career that any man living might envy you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A certain personage was heard to say after your speech: <i>
That is the man I need</i>. Don't look as if you saw a ghost. You deserve it
all, my dear Richard.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Walks up and down in agitated silence</i>.) Ludwig--you
have led me to the top of a high mountain and shown me the promised land in
which I shall never set foot. Give me time to renounce the idea.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why should you talk of renouncing it? But this brings me to
the object of my visit. Richard, how long do you suppose your enemies will wait
before making capital out of your speech?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm ready for them, my dear fellow. I'll pay the shot--to the
last penny!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span> (<i>in a lower tone</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">We are talking at cross-purposes. I referred to the
insinuations of your former secretary.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I understand.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You know there is nothing they are so eager to attack as our
private life. Of course I don't for a moment imagine the man has anything to go
on--but unless you can silence him he may make a scandal in which everything
will go under--your name, your career--and other things besides.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What can I do to prevent it?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For one thing, you might jump into a cab and hunt your man
down with a big bribe in your pocket.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you think that kind of man could be bribed?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Baron Ludwig</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Richard, this is not merely a matter of life and
death. Remember that. Of course you may be too late; but it's the only way I can
suggest. (<i>There is a knock on the door</i>.)</p>

<p class="normal">Herr Meixner, after what has happened, doesn't it strike you
as rather a liberty that you should enter my house?</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Speaking in a hoarse voice, with an occasional cough</i>.)

<p class="normal">May I ask what you want of me?</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really, Baron, from the way you look at me I might almost ask
what you want of <i>me</i>. But I suppose it's my turn first.--I haven't come
out of malice. You can safely offer me a chair.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you haven't come out of malice you probably won't stay long
enough to need one.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--thanks. Well, I'll take the hint and be brief. It was down
at Lengenfeld, you know. Herr Holtzmann and I sat up a whole night arguing over
the elections. Why not--two honourable antagonists, eh? Herr Holtzmann, as a
good theologian, was all for the sanctity of the social order. I laughed at
him--he's at the age when the disciple looks up to his master, and he brought
you up as an example. I laughed at him again.--&quot;If Baron Völkerlingk is not what
I believe him to be,&quot; said he, &quot;nothing is what I believe it to be, and I'll go
over to your side.&quot; &quot;Shake hands on that,&quot; said I; and we did. The next day, in
my speech, I made that allusion--you know what I mean--and as no one took it up,
and I began to be afraid it might hang fire, I sent about a few copies of the
paper. That helped. I got my nomination the next day.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not in my district.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No matter. Well I found I'd made a stupid blunder. I'd meant
to convert Holtzmann but I hadn't meant to ruin <i>you</i>. Do you see? Then you
made your speech to-day--and after that-- Well, I've been tramping the streets
ever since, saying to myself: The man who could make that speech after what he's
been through--well, he's suffered enough.--Baron Völkerlingk, here are two
letters written to you by-- (<i>he looks about him cautiously</i>) by a lady I
needn't name. Don't ask me how I got them. I didn't steal them; and here they
are, if you'll give me your word that you'll put a stop to that libel-suit.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I think the suit has already been stopped.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--well, your thinking so is hardly sufficient.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It will have to be stopped, even if you keep those letters.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span> (<i>startled</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Even if--? H'm--do things look as badly as that for you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You will kindly leave me out of the question.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--well--here are your letters. (<i>Lays them on the table</i>.)</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you didn't wish to do me a public injury, why not have
shown them privately to my secretary?</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They might have been forgeries.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They may be so still.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When I've taken the trouble to return them to you? Holtzmann
doesn't think so. He's packing up already. Perhaps you'd like to see him before
he leaves?</p>

<p class="normal">No.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Meixner</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Baron Völkerlingk, if I have got you into trouble don't set it
down to ill-feeling. Principle is principle, if we have to hang for it. Every

I promise you!</p>

<p class="normal">Richard, for fifteen years we haven't kept a single thought
from each other, yet now that the end has come you throw me over as if you were
paying off a discarded mistress.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>agitated</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Beata!</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't be afraid. I am not going to force your confidence. You
would only repeat what Michael has already told me--that you are going to
travel, to disappear for a while.--Is this the laugh with which we were to have
greeted death? Often and often, at night, when I've lain in bed struggling for
breath, I've said to myself that I should die before morning. What if it really
happened to-night? You'd have to wait then--you'd have no right to follow me.
Think how people would talk if you did! (<i>With a sudden start</i>.) The
children, Richard--there must be no shadow on the children.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata, don't talk so wildly. Do shake off such fancies.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>musing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--yes.--You know you'll have a note from Michael in the
morning.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A note asking you to luncheon to-morrow to meet some friends.
Nothing more.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is the object----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems there has been some gossip at the clubs, and this is
the shortest way of putting a stop to it. (<i>Entreatingly</i>.) You'll come,
Richard, won't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beata! Why should we go through this new misery?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>in wild anxiety</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Richard, you <i>will</i> come? You must come.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I can't, Beata.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is the last thing I shall ever ask of you. Now you're
smiling again--well, I'll believe anything you tell me--about your travelling,
about your disappearing--I'll believe anything, if you'll only come. Richard,
come for the children's sake. And if not for the children's sake, come for
mine--or I shall die of it--I shall die of it, Richard, in the night----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span> (<i>overcome</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I will come.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Give me your hand. (<span class="sc2">Richard </span><i>gives
it</i>. <span class="sc2">Beata </span><i>takes his hand, and passes it over her
eyes and cheeks</i>.) There--I'm quite quiet again, you see. (<i>Sits down</i>.)
I don't know if I told you that I'm going to Rossitsch to-morrow.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For good?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>nodding</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">So that, unless you come and pay me a visit there----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">This is good-bye? For always. So you needn't keep yourself so
frightfully in hand. (<i>He looks at her doubtfully</i>.) You needn't, really. (<i>He
falls on his knees before her and hides his face in her lap</i>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span> (<i>stroking his hair</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I knew a sad old tale of Tristram and Iseult&quot;--How grey
you've grown in these last few days! (<i>She kisses his hair</i>.) Don't get up
yet--I want to look at you again--for the last time.--Only I can't see you--your

used to--just once!</p>

<p class="normal">I've never changed to you.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Haven't you?--Who knows?--We've grown old, you and I. There's
a layer of ashes on our hearts--a layer of conventionality and good behaviour
and weariness and disappointment.--Who knows what we were like before the fire
went out? Not a trace is left to tell--not so much as a riband or a flower. The
words are forgotten, the letters are destroyed, the emotions have faded. Here we
sit like two ghosts on our own graves. (<i>Passionately</i>.) Oh, to go back
just once to the old life, and then forget everything----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is that?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Listen. (<i>Reading</i>.) &quot;I don't want to sleep, dearest. The
night is too bright and my happiness too great. The moonlight lies on Likowa,
and already the dawn shows red through the network of elms. The blood beats like
a hammer in my temples--I scarcely know how I am going to bear the riches of my
new life. Oh, how I pray God to let me live it out beside you--not as your wife,
that would be too wild a dream!--but as an unseen influence at your side, faint
as the moonlight which rests upon your sleep, or as the first glow of dawn that
wakes you to new endeavour.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I must have been listening to Wagner. Let me see; did I really
write that? (<i>She reads</i>.) &quot;For I mean to make you the greatest among men,
you, my discoverer and my deliverer--&quot; That's not so bad, you know. (<i>Reads on</i>.)
&quot;If only heaven would let me die, and give you my life to live as well as your

<p class="normal">This letter and another have just been brought to me
by--Meixner. If he had come yesterday we should have been saved. Now it is too
late.</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Too late?--Oh, Richard, how ungrateful I've been! Why, every
prayer of my youth has been granted--the long sad sweet dream at your side-- (<i>She

<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why do you laugh?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I laugh because in your speech this morning you disowned us
both--disowned our long sad sweet dream. Oh, I don't blame you, Richard. It
isn't your conscience that torments you, it's the conscience of the race. I'm
only a woman--what do I care for the race? You felt that you were sinning--I
felt that I had risen above myself, that I had attained the harmony nature meant
me to attain. And because I feel that----</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Richard</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You deny that we have sinned----?</p>
<br>
<p class="stage"><span class="sc">Beata</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I deny nothing. I affirm nothing. I stand on the farther shore
of life, and look over at you with a smile. Oh, Richard, Richard (<i>she laughs</i>),
did you ever really think I had given you up? I never gave you up. I never
ceased to long for you, passionately, feverishly, day and night, when you were
away and when you were near me--always, always--and all the while I was playing
the cool, quiet friend, biting my lips to keep the words back, and crushing down
my rebellious heart--yes, and through it all I was so happy--so unspeakably,
supremely happy----</p>
<br>

living! Do you really think you're alive--any one of you? Or do you think I am?
(<i>She springs up with an inspired look</i>.) But I, at least--I--whose whole
life is one long struggle against death--I who never sleep, who hardly breathe,
who barely stand--I at least know how to laugh, how to love life and be thankful
